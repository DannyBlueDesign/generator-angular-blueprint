Angular js Generator for large scale applications. 

Based on [John Papa's AngularJS Style Guide](https://github.com/johnpapa/angularjs-styleguide). 
The goal is to have an out of the box scaffolding that will scale well for large complex applications.


Generator Angular Blueprint introducing the idea of blueprints to an angular scaffolding. It is now very simple to overwrite generator templates in your local project.
Lots of Yeoman generators are out there, but what if you don't agree? You can fork the repo and make changes and install it on your own, OR, you can use generator-angular-blueprints.
Don't like the style of comments we have chosen? Use your own! Simply create a folder in your root project called "blueprints".

```
npm install -g generator-angular-blueprint
```

The file structure below is how to override each of the potential templates.

* /
  - blueprints
    * controller
      - controller.js
    * view
      - view.js
    * style
      - style.scss
    * service
      - controller.js
    * factory
      - controller.js
    * directive
      - directive.js
    * router
      - router.js
    * spec
      - spec.js
  - client
  - docs

Now when ever you run ```yo angular-blueprint:controller foo``` it will use your own controller template.
The following template values are passed in to each template and are available for you to use.

```
<%= appName %> // myApp
<%= classedName %> // ClassedName
<%= dashedName %> // dashed-name
<%= humanName %> // human name
<%= type %> // {controller|factory|service|directive}
```

client/app/services/user/user.spec.js
```

### Directive
